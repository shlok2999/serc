            <h3>Standardization of Mobile Interfaces</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>To define the standards for mobile interfaces for the Enterprise CA Product Suite. User and Task analysis is an important component of assessing any specific products usability.If the user has to undergo a rigorous learning process to use
                a specific application or a product, the chances of the product succeeding in the market place will decrease.From an end user perspective, we can intuitively state that every application / product's user interface will involvedifferent
                set of behaviours and therefore require some amount of learning. The difficulty lies in reducing the amount of learning. This is applicable to internal developers of CA as well as external developers.</p>

            <h3>Big Data Analytics on the cloud</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>The Objectives of this project is to 1. Study and build various available Big Data technology stacks like Hadoop Big data platform, Mapreduce programming models, and search softwares such as Lucene and Solr. 2.Provide Proof of concept on a.
                Real- time search on CA product log files and b. Analytics on CA Risk Minder's Device DNA data.</p>

            <h3>Virtual Lab Integration</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>Deployment and Maintenance of Virtual Labs. The scope of the project includes building infrastructure to provide access to quality labs to all colleges across India, building a complete Learning management system and conduct training workshops
                for teacher training and skill-set augmentation.</p>

                <li>SERC-VL2- Central Platform and Engineering</li>
                <li>SERC-VL2-Intergration and Maintenance</li>
                <li>SERC-VL2-Outreach</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Virtual labs project addresses the issue of lack of good lab facilities, as well as tained teachers, by making remote and simulation based experimentation possible through world wide web. With the present day internet and computer technologies,
                these limitations no longer hamper students and researchers in enhancing their skills and knowledge. The Objective is to arouse the curiosity of the students and permit them to learn at their own pace.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Access to quality labs to those engineering colleges which lack these lab facilities.</li>
                <li>Access to quality labs as a complementary facility to those colleges that already have labs</li>
                <li>A complete Learning management system around the labs.</li>
                <li>Teacher-training and skill-set augmentation through workshop and on-site training.</li>

            <h3>Large-scale distributed model checking</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>Implementation of Model checking on distrubuted cloud-based platforms in order to make model checking efficient and scalable. Hopefully, widen the scope of industry-based problems to which model checking can be applied.</p>
