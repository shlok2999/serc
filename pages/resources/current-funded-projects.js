            <h3>Design Innovation Centre</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>Project Title: Design Innovation Centre</p>
            <p>Funding Agency: Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD)</p>
            <p>Design-Centered innovation is a force multiplier that can help in the country move up the value chain, making Indian industry globally competitive. In this context, Ministry of Human Resource Development proposes to launch a National Initiative
                for Design Innovation in the Twelfth Plan. Under this initiative, 20 new design Innovation Centers (DIC), one Open Design school (ODS) and a National Design Innovation Network (NDIN), linking together all theses schools and other allied
                bodies such as leading institutions of Industry and academics, NGOs and government would be set up. To be part of this noble venture, The Department of Design at IIIT Hyderabad is setting itself up as one of the Design Innovation Centers.
                Since a ‘HUB &amp; Spoke’ model is to be adopted, The Department of Design, IIIT Hyderabad would be a Hub and it plans to partner with the following institutes of national repute which would function as its spokes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"A Service-based approach to design and Build serious games for creating community Knowledge”</li>
                <li>Framework and tool for Accessibility and Usability testing and other NFR testing for Government Application using Crowdsourcing models.</li>

            <h3>Development of Security Search Engine</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>Project Title: Development of Security Search Engine</p>
            <p>Funding Agency: Interdisciplinary Cyber Physical System (ICPS) –DST, GOI.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Provide relevant and current information on various topics in security based on search criteria. Rank the results in the order of relevance and based on the credibility of website containing theinformation. As an example, if search results
                    meet query criteria – security content available in Government websites like CERT-In could be shown with higher ranking.
                </li>
                <li>Build Security Search Engine using scalable and extensible Open source software.</li>
                <li>Provide Top Vulnerabilities, Threats and Advisories based on the retrieved information. The would contain actionable information for mitigating against security related risks. BFSI sector, Government entities, Healthcare industry and all
                    others that contain sensitive information and have a need to protect their IT infrastructure will benefit with these top trends. There may be multiple vulnerabilities across different software platforms, showing with actionable information
                    of highly used OS would be more relevant. This relevance should also be based on the impact that the vulnerability could create such as remote vis-à-vis an unnecessary process that is consuming memory.
                </li>
                <li>Provide relevant Security specific visualization based on search criteria. An example of thiswould be for a search on ‘Phishing’ - provide visualization on the “Lures – Amount” or 'Phishing –Country wise Incidents’ and others.
                </li>
                <li>Contain feature for RSS Feed and Alerts based on user criteria (keyword, frequency, etc). This would help MSME and other small scale users of IT for better preparedness from security vulnerabilities.</li>
